## About this repo.
There is an app to manage develop projects in the folder /Proyecto-Final-P5
There is another application that consists of a university application, it needs more work to do, but the basics work well. Is in /P5-ELearning-v2
-->Other proyects<--
I also prepare 2 little proyects, one is Typer-d, it is a single game that should give you more skills when you type, be aware of your keyboard :) , you can change the words that are in the array, it is easy to do... on the other hand, there is a ToDo list, which is a simple todo list, I don´t use a DB so whatever you write there will be erase when you close the web explorer..

## First of all,
 I haven't done alone, a few people work with me, you can reach them through theirs repo
 
 [Virgi's Repo](https://github.com/VirgiRom/)
 
- This is just the begining..
The app consists of a place where the project manager could manage their development projects, it's working but needs more work to do.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mic-iq/Proyecto-Final-P5
``` 
and you can start to colaborate or just see what I have done, for this proyect I have to use a Salesforce Developer edition Org, there is a lot of work to do if you want to import all proyect, in my case I use ANT

```bash
ant deployCode
```
maybe you need to do some manual work but at least you have all code there.
